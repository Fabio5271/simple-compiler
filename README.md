# simple-compiler
SIMPLE Programming Language compiler written in Python, that generates a Simpletron Machine Language binary.

This is a completed university project in the subject of compilers, made with the objective of understanding how a basic compiler works. This is not a compiler designed for speed and efficiency, as after all, it would have to have been written in C to excel at that. This is a program focused on functionality, as well as demonstrating many Python development concepts in practice.
