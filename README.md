# simple-compiler
SIMPLE Programming Language compiler written in Python, that generates a Simpletron Machine Language binary.

This is a completed university project in the subject of compilers, made with the objective of understanding how a basic compiler works. This is not a compiler designed for speed and efficiency, as after all, it would have to have been written in C to excel at that. This is a program focused on functionality, as well as demonstrating many Python development concepts in practice.

To use the compiler, insert the source code into source.txt, and run compiler.py. The output binary will be saved as binary.txt.
