# simple-compiler
SIMPLE Programming Language compiler written in Python, that generates a Simpletron Machine Language binary.

This is a completed university project in the subject of compilers, made with the objective of understanding how a basic compiler works. Think of this as a proof of concept, more than a compiler designed for speed and efficiency, after all, for starters, it would have to have been written in C to have a chance at excelling at that.
